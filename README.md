# Î¼Widgets

Micro Widgets for Compose Multiplatform.

1. Goals
  * Simple implementation
  * Simple to use
  * Useful especially to show a lot of details even on small (micro) devices
  * Useful especially for different kind of monitoring / debug info UI.
2. TODO
  * TODO later: publish UDemo/JS with github actions
    * https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-your-github-pages-site#publishing-with-a-custom-github-actions-workflow
    * https://github.com/hfhbd/bootstrap-compose/pull/257/files
  * TODO later: mordant backend
    * https://github.com/ajalt/mordant
  * TODO someday maybe: gtk-kn backend
    * https://gitlab.com/gtk-kn/gtk-kn/-/boards
    * but I guess I would first try to wrap their canvas to have compose native widgets
    * and maybe second "subproject" would be to wrap gtk-kn widgets in uwidgets as separate option
